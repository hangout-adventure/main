            Rock climbing has increased in popularity in the last 15–20 years
            both as a recreational physical activity and as a competitive sport.
            Rock climbing is the branch of climbing in which the element of
            danger is reduced by pre-placing protection points in the rock.
            Manali entices amateur as well as seasoned climbers from all over
            the world as it provides great rocks and conducive environment for
            climbing.
            <p>
              We organize rock-climbing and bouldering in Northern part of
              India. Himalayan terrain offers various opportunities for this
              sport. We have a team of qualified climbers who are skilled to
              pave new routes in slabs of rocks or overhanging rocks.

            The Himalayas are the birthplace of many important rivers. The
            rivers originating from Himalayas give all together new dimension to
            the natural scenic beauty and life.

              White water rafting is perhaps the most popular water adventure
              sport in India, and even tops our list. Steering your way through
              the gushing waters on an inflatable boat is highly invigorating as
              well as challenging. The excitement lies in getting wet, tiding
              over the turbulent waters thus taming them and emerging out
              victorious.

            landscape and nurtured by the locals. Mountain biking
            demands cycle handling skills, endurance and it proves to be an
            ultimate test of nerve and bike control. The guides accompanying you
